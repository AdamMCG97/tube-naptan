# tube-naptan

I created this repo after having difficulty finding this data myself. I provide 2 formats, JSON and CSV.Both of which contain naptanID and commanName. The data shouldn't need to be updated often, but should it need to be then there is a ascript included which will do this automatically.

## Formats

- [CSV](https://github.com/ZackaryH8/tube-naptan/blob/master/data/naptan.csv)
- [JSON](https://github.com/ZackaryH8/tube-naptan/blob/master/data/naptan.json)

## Updating the Data

`yarn run update` - Updates the JSON and CSV

## Contributing

- Contributions for Javascript will be considered
- Pull Requests for /data **will** be closed
